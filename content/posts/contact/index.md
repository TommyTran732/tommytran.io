## Other Accounts

### Telegram

My Telegram is [TommyTran732](https://t.me/tommytran732). I do not check it as often as I do with Matrix or Discord. When contacting me, please use the [Secret Chat](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-do-i-start-a-secret-chat) feature.

### Facebook & Instagram
- TommyTran732

I only use Meta services as a fallback communication method with my real life friends. Please do not send me any friend requests unless I really know you. I only list these here for identity verification purposes.

Also, as of this writing (02/04/2026), Instagram E2EE is completely broken, so please do not send me an encrypted message on Instagram as I will not actually receive it.

### Git accounts
- [GitHub](https://github.com/tommytran732)
- [Metropolis GitLab](https://git.metropolis.nexus/tommy)

Please by wary of anyone claiming to be me or using the handle "TommyTran732" reaching out to you. Chances are, they are an impersonator. You can always contact me via Matrix or Email for identity verification.
