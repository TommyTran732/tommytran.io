I’m currently open to new opportunities and eager to join a team in the U.S. or Canada as an employee. I do not take on freelance or contract work. For U.S. opportunities, I don’t require visa sponsorship at this time, though I may need it in the future. For Canadian opportunities, I will need an employer to apply for a work permit on my behalf. If you’re looking for a committed team member, let’s connect!

## What I Can Do

As a system administrator with 5 years of experience, I bring extensive expertise working with all three major Linux families—Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian—with a particular preference for Red Hat systems. While I am primarily a Linux administrator, I am also familiar with Windows systems and can handle tasks such as managing Active Directory.

I prioritize creating secure and reliable systems, implementing measures like systemd hardening, container hardening, timely vulnerability patching for containers, attack surface reduction, and protecting systems from both external and internal threats.

Most of my work is open source and available on GitHub. You can explore my server configurations on [Metropolis Nexus's GitHub](https://github.com/metropolis-nexus) to see my approach to system administration. For container security, I specialize in porting containers to Alpine Linux and performing daily rebuilds to ensure the latest patches are applied. Check out my work at [Polarix-Containers](https://github.com/polarix-containers), where I maintain a collection of OCI containers with enhanced protections.

## Qualifications

I hold several professional certifications, including the **Red Hat Certified System Administrator** and **Linux Foundation Certified Sysadmin**, demonstrating my expertise in Linux system administration.

I am committed to continuous learning and plan to pursue additional certifications in the near future to further enhance my skills.
