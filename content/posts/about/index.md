Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thien, though you may know me as Tommy. With over five years of experience as a Linux system administrator, I specialize in managing a diverse range of Linux distributions, including Red Hat, Debian, SUSE, and Arch Linux. Recently, I've been diving into the world of containers and immutable distributions, which I find both innovative and exciting.

Like most Linux users, I am an open source enthusiast and publish most of the projects made in my free time on [GitHub](https://github.com/tommytran732). I also made a couple of small contributions to various projets as well.

I host several services, such as Matrix and Mastodon, free of charge. If you're curious, feel free to explore [Metropolis Nexus](https://metropolis.nexus), where you might find resources or services that suit your needs.

Together with friends I connected with through GrapheneOS, I co-author a blog, [PrivSec.dev](https://privsec.dev), where we explore topics related to privacy and security.
