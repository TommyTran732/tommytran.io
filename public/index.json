For U.S. opportunities, I donâ€™t require visa sponsorship at this time, though I may need it in the future. For Canadian opportunities, I will need an employer to apply for a work permit on my behalf. If youâ€™re looking for a committed team member, letâ€™s connect!\nWhat I Can Do # As a system administrator with 5 years of experience, I bring extensive expertise working with all three major Linux familiesâ€”Red Hat, SUSE, and Debianâ€”with a particular preference for Red Hat systems. While I am primarily a Linux administrator, I am also familiar with Windows systems and can handle tasks such as managing Active Directory.\nI prioritize creating secure and reliable systems, implementing measures like systemd hardening, container hardening, timely vulnerability patching for containers, attack surface reduction, and protecting systems from both external and internal threats.\nMost of my work is open source and available on GitHub. You can explore my server configurations on Metropolis Nexus\u0026rsquo;s GitHub to see my approach to system administration. For container security, I specialize in porting containers to Alpine Linux and performing daily rebuilds to ensure the latest patches are applied. Check out my work at Polarix-Containers, where I maintain a collection of OCI containers with enhanced protections.\nQualifications # I hold several professional certifications, including the Red Hat Certified System Administrator and Linux Foundation Certified Sysadmin, demonstrating my expertise in Linux system administration. For a full list of my certifications, please visit my LinkedIn profile. I am committed to continuous learning and plan to pursue additional certifications in the near future to further enhance my skills.\n","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/hire-me/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"I am open to work!","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Tommy's Space","summary":"","title":"Tommy's Space","type":"page"},{"content":"Hello! ðŸ‘‹\nI\u0026rsquo;m Thien, though you may know me as Tommy.

Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been diving into the world of containers and immutable distributions, which I find both innovative and exciting.\nLike most Linux users, I am an open source enthusiast and publish most of the projects made in my free time on GitHub. I also made a couple of small contributions to various projets as well.\nI host several services, such as Matrix and Mastodon, free of charge.
